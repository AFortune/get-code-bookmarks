# get-code-bookmarks

This is a simple [Python](http://python.org) script for extracting
programming-related bookmarks from [Firefox](http://firefox.com/), or
browsers based on the same engine, such as my preferred browser
[Conkeror](http://conkeror.org/).  See the comment at the beginning of
the script for a more detailed explanation on how to use the program.
Or run `pydoc ./get-code-bookmarks.py` in the directory containing the
script.

I just hacked this together to share programming links with friends on
a mailing list.  The code is Public Domain, so you may do whatever you
want with it.
