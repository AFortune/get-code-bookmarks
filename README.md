# get-code-bookmarks

This is a simple [Python](http://python.org) script for extracting
programming-related bookmarks from Firefox, or browsers based on the
same engine.  See the comment at the beginning of the script for a
more detailed explanation on how to use the program.

I just hacked this together to share programming links with friends on
a mailing list.  The code is Public Domain, so you may do whatever you
want with it.
